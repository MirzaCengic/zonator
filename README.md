# zonator

`zonator` is a utility R package for dealing with various tasks related to
[Zonation](http://www.helsinki.fi/bioscience/consplan/software/Zonation/index.html)

of helper scripts which have now been packages for anybody interested in using
a familiar tool (R) in setting up Zonation runs and managing Zonation results.

of running a Zonation analysis.

1. Setting up a Zonation project and pre-processing files ([examples](http://cbig.github.io/zonator/vignettes/zonator-project.html)).
