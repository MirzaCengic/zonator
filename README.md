# zonator

`zonator` is a utility R package for dealing with various tasks related to
[Zonation](http://www.helsinki.fi/bioscience/consplan/software/Zonation/index.html) 
conservation prioritization software. The package started out as a collection
of helper scripts which have now been packages for anybody interested in using
a familiar tool (R) in setting up Zonation runs and managing Zonation results.

**NOTE that the scripts are strictly alpha quality. Do not expect any sort 
of stability at least before 0.5 release.**
